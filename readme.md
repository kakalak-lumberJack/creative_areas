# Creative_areas 

Creative Areas is a minetest mod allowing areas defined by the Areas mod to be designated as creative/sandbox areas adjusting players privliges and inventory formspecs appropriately as they leave or enter these areas.

* Use /creative_area <area ID number> to add area to list of areas where creative mode is enabled. 
* Use /rm_creative_areas <area ID number> to remove an area from the list.

Depends on Advanced Areas Mod by Shadow Ninja and the Creative mod included in Minetest Game.
